# Projects
A brief summary of the projects that I have been working on this far in the 3+ years as a CS student.

I made a Streaming Service "Simulation" using C. Made two(2) versions of it, one only using basic data structures like single and double linked lists, and one using lists as well as binary search trees and leaf-oriented binary search trees. The available "actions" were to register and unregister a user, add a new movie, distribute movies from a general purpose structure to per-category, sorted, movie list and a consume/watch movie function. I also made a movie suggestion function as well as a filtered movie search function. All this, with specified time complexity, specifically declared by the Data Structures course teacher.

I made a Stratego board game project using Java from scratch. Pawns could move on the board, interact with each other, following certain rules based on their color, their "pawn ability", and their ability to move freely or not.

I made a linux shell as a project on my Operating Systems course. Extensive use of process and string manipulation was needed.

I made a Student/Bus/University system were multiple student threads would wait in a certain bus stop to take the bus, wiat for it to take them to the university where they could study for X amound of time until they could wait for the bus again to return home. Extensive use of threads, mutexes and semaphores was needed.

I have worked as a team of two(2) to carry out a lexer, a parser, and an intermediate code generator for a Compilers course. They were based on the programming language "Alpha" and all 3 "phases" of the project were announced "flawless" by the TAs.
